/*
Platform :- Codeforces 
Contest :- Codeforces Round 723 Div 2
Problem :- C1 Potions
Approch :- I was not able to figure out for solution during contests but it was an good proble
           Approach is to take a variable tot and add value A[i] for 0<=i<n and increment our "count"
            i . if A[i]<0 then add it to min priority queue
            ii. if tot<0 we subtract the smallest value of priority queue from tot and decrement our "count"
