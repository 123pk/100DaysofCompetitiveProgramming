Problem :- TWINGFT
Contest :- Codechef lunchtime
Approach :- take in mind thaat in last move one playe two values , we need to maximise our score so we will sort the array in decreasing order 
            then in alternate turn we will choose the max value left except for last turn . 
            The one with maximum value is our solution
