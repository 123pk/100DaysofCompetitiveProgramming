Platform :- Codeforces 
Contest :- Codeforces Round 295
Problem :- two bottoms
Approach :-  if m<n then we have only one option is to substract 1 from it and it will take (n-m) steps ,
             else if "m" is odd it will take 2 steps , we will multiply by 2 and then substract 1, if it is even it will take one step , we will do this until we get m<n
