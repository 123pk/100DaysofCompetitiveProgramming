Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 726 #Div 2
Problem :- A - Arithmetic Array
Approach :- find the sum of values of array if (sum<n) ans=1 , as we can add ((n-(sum))+1) value to array which will give us mean =1 , else 
            we need to add ( sum - n) 0's to array to make mean =1 so ans in this case is (sum-n)
