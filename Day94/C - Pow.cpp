Problem :- C - pow
Contest :- Atcoder Beginner contest 205
Approach :- there are three cases 
            Case 1 :- both 'a' & 'b' are +ve in this case which ever element is greater will have greater 'c'th power  value
            Case 2 :- either one is negative here if 'c' is even then element with highest absolute value will have greater cth power , else if odd power then 
                      value which is positive has greater value
            Case 3 :- both negative same as case 1
